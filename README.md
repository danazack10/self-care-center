// CHOSEN TASK: User can delete a message
// --> Add the ability to delete a messge (ie: when a message shows up, 
// show a button that says “I don’t like this messge” (or something similar), 
// and remove it from the list so that it will not show up any more. Make sure
// to alert the user in some way that the message has been removed.
// --> NOTE: None of this needs to persist on page refresh, unless you also
// complete the local storage feature.
